# Project 2: Words In Motion


## Project Overview
Community can mean a lot of things. For me, I view community as the people you love and love you back. My community is my family, my girlfriend, and her family. The written word I chose that represents that is "Glue Song" by Beabadoobee. For context, I have been dating my girlfriend for a little over 5 years. So overtime my family and her family have gotten very close and we consider our two families as one at this point. One line that highlights my community is
"I'm not wrong when I say I by the glue onto you" I want the audience to understand how close I am to my loved ones. And how this is really the only community that I have.


## Technical Overview
Translate written word that describes community, into a visually appealing and smooth website, using animations to give words value and meaning. 

## Acknowledgment
Here is one source that should give an idea of what I am envisioning for this project.
